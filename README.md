# STX-Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoins Smart Contract

This project implements a decentralized system for issuing stablecoins backed by Bitcoin (BTC) using the **Stacks blockchain**. The smart contracts enable minting, burning, and managing stablecoins while ensuring proper collateralization through dynamic BTC price updates from a trusted oracle. The system supports liquidation of under-collateralized positions, dynamic adjustment of collateralization ratios, and incentivizes users through interest accrual.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Collateralized Stablecoin System**
- Users can lock Bitcoin collateral (BTC) to mint stablecoins.
- Stablecoins are backed by BTC at a dynamically adjustable collateralization ratio (`min-collateral-ratio`).

### 2. **Dynamic Collateralization Ratio**
- Administrators can adjust the minimum collateral ratio (`min-collateral-ratio`) as needed to adapt to changing market conditions.

### 3. **BTC Price Oracle**
- BTC prices are sourced via a decentralized price oracle, updated by authorized reporters.
- Prices are aggregated and validated before being used in the system.

### 4. **Liquidation**
- Under-collateralized positions can be liquidated to maintain system stability.

### 5. **Interest Mechanism**
- Users holding stablecoins earn interest based on their balances.
- Interest is periodically distributed and can be claimed by users.

### 6. **System Pause**
- The system can be paused by the administrator to respond to emergencies, halting operations like minting and burning.

## **Key Workflows**

### **1. Minting Stablecoins**
1. Users lock BTC collateral using `lock-collateral`.
2. The system verifies that the collateralization ratio is sufficient using `is-collateral-sufficient`.
3. Users mint stablecoins using `mint-stablecoin`.

### **2. Burning Stablecoins**
1. Users burn stablecoins using `burn-stablecoin`.
2. The system unlocks the equivalent BTC collateral based on the current BTC price.

### **3. Liquidation**
1. Any user can call `liquidate` on under-collateralized positions.
2. The system seizes and deletes the userâ€™s collateral and stablecoin balances.

### **4. Interest Accrual**
1. The admin periodically calls a script (off-chain) to distribute interest using `distribute-interest`.
2. Users claim their interest using `claim-interest`.

## **Admin Capabilities**
- Adjust the collateral ratio dynamically.
- Pause or unpause the system in emergencies.
- Manage the whitelist of oracle reporters.
- Submit and update BTC price data.

---

## **Security Features**
1. **Collateralization Ratio Enforcement**:
   - Ensures positions remain over-collateralized to protect against volatility.

2. **Liquidation**:
   - Removes under-collateralized positions to maintain system solvency.

3. **Oracle Whitelisting**:
   - Restricts BTC price submissions to trusted reporters.

4. **System Pause**:
   - Allows the admin to halt minting and burning operations in emergencies.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   - Validates BTC prices and ensures data is not stale.

---

## **Deployment Guide**
1. Deploy the `price-oracle` contract.
2. Deploy the `stx-bitcoin-backed-stablecoins` contract with the oracle's contract address set in `get-btc-price`.
3. Add reporters to the whitelist using `add-reporter`.
4. Begin submitting BTC price data through authorized reporters.
5. Users can lock collateral and mint stablecoins once the system is operational.

## **Future Improvements**
1. **DAO Governance**:
   - Transition admin rights to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

2. **Dynamic Oracle Integration**:
   - Allow integration with multiple oracles for improved price reliability.

3. **Multi-Collateral Support**:
   - Expand the system to support other collateral types.

4. **Automated Interest Distribution**:
   - Implement automated scripts for distributing interest on-chain.
